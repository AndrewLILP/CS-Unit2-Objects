- Sprint set up for Assignment 3
- Epic 1: Core Game Enhancement (4.5h)
- Story 1.1: Difficulty Progression System (1.5h)
- Role: Game Designer + Programmer
- Tasks:
    - Design difficulty curve (spawn rate, enemy health, player challenges)
    - Implement dynamic enemy spawn rate scaling
    - Add wave-based progression system
    - Balance testing and tweaks
    - Acceptance Criteria: Game gets progressively harder over time with max spawn rate cap
- Working:
    - Level 1 (0-19 pts): Only melee enemies, slow spawn rate
    - Level 2 (20-39 pts): Melee + Exploder enemies
    - Level 3 (40-59 pts): Melee + Exploder + Shooter enemies
    - Level 4 (60-79 pts): All enemies, but Machine Gun is nerfed
    - Level 5+ (80+ pts): All enemies at full power, spawn rate capped
